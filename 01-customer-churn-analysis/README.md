# Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction

## Problem Statement
Customer churn is a major challenge for subscription-based businesses. The goal of this project is to analyze customer behavior and build a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn.

## Business Objective
- Identify key factors influencing customer churn
- Predict churn probability for each customer
- Help businesses take proactive retention actions

## Dataset
- Source: Telecom Customer Churn Dataset
- Rows: ~7,000 customers
- Features: Demographics, services used, billing, tenure
- Target variable: Churn (Yes/No)

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Project Workflow
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Building (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
5. Model Evaluation
6. Business Insights & Recommendations

## Key Insights
- Customers with short tenure have higher churn
- Month-to-month contracts show highest churn
- High monthly charges increase churn risk

## Model Performance
- Accuracy: ~80%
- Evaluation Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

## Business Impact
This model helps businesses:
- Identify high-risk customers
- Reduce churn by targeted retention campaigns
- Increase customer lifetime value
